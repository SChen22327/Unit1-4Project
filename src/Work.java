                The rules of this game are
                  1. You have 7 days/rounds to earn $%s.
                  2. Every day, you will be asked to add an item to the menu. You can give it a price OR make it free.
                  3. You can buy upgrades which will greatly increase the money you earn but decreases the amount of
                     money you have(see rule 5).
                  4. You can work each day to earn money. Any upgrades will be applied at the end of each work action.
                  5. You can ONLY choose to work or upgrade each day, you can't do both.
                      a. You can increase your actions by 1, allowing you to do two things each day.
                      b. If you choose to upgrade, you may only choose to upgrade one thing.
                      c. The amount of money made somewhat depends on the number of items on your menu, which increases
                         by 1 each day, meaning you'll likely earn more later on.
                  6. If you fail to earn enough money or run out of money, you will lose.%n""", goal); //(2)
